News and Their Impacts on Crypto Currencies
This project aims to analyze the short-term impact of crypto-related news on cryptocurrency prices.
Specifically, it investigates how market-moving news affects price changes within 20 seconds after the news is published.
The study will focus on major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL) over the past one year.
The goal is to identify whether positive or negative sentiment in news headlines leads to immediate price reactions and to build a machine learning model that can predict the magnitude and direction of these short-term movements.

Data Sources
1-OHLCV Data
I am planning to collect market datas from open source APIs like Binance, Bybit, and OKX.

2-News Data 
The most influential crypto-related news is often first shared through Telegram channels such as Infinity Hedge, Phoenix News, and Tree News.
I plan to collect timestamped news data from these channels and process the text to extract sentiment and key entities like coin names, event types.
