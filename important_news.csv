ICYMI: UK overtook China to become the second-largest U.S. Treasury holder for the first time ever; Moody’s lowered the US credit score to Aa1 from Aaa on Friday; Bessent said on Sunday that U.S. may impose some tariffs by region rather than on individual countries, as time runs out to negotiate a laundry list of trade deals globally. Bessent told NBC that if they’re not negotiating in good faith, they are going to get a letter saying here is the rate, so I would expect that everyone would come and negotiate in good faith, Those that get the letter will face the tariff rate that the White House announced on April 2.

Those tariffs would last for only up to 150 days, after which the law requires Congressional action to extend.  ***Sec. 232 tariffs, which President Trump has already used for steel, aluminum, and autos, could be broadened to cover other sectors. We already expect additional sectoral tariffs (pharmaceuticals, semiconductors/electronics, etc) and uncertainty regarding the IEEPA-based tariffs could lead the White House to put more emphasis on sectoral tariffs**, where there is much less legal uncertainty: GS  *In conclusion, the bulk of Trump's tariffs - which clearly are now targeting just a handful of trading partners such as China, EU and Japan - can and most likely will stay, even if SCOTUS does not void the trade court ruling on appeal: GS",16347,False,,True

2025-08-23 18:19:59+03:00,infinityhedge,26055,"Too much misinformation about Powell's speech going around, so here's the short summary: INFINITYHEDGE   ***Powell left the door open for Sept. Rate Cut but signaled it won't be the start of aggressive easing.**  *On the labor market, Powell said ”the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of & demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs.  *On inflation, Powell said: The effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing & amounts... A reasonable base case is that the effects will be a one-time shift in the price level. Ofc, “one-time” does not mean “all at once.” It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains...& Ofc we cannot take the stability of inflation expectations for granted. Come what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem.  ***In Conclusion, Powell said: In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment to the downside—a challenging situation**... Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate & other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook **and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance**.  **<Policy Framework Change>:** (we covered it already here: https://t.me/infinityhedge/26042 before Powell's Speech but still misinformation spreading, & please don't blindly trust twitter influencers)  Powell said the Fed has adopted a new framework, Key Changes: ↳ removed ELB ↳ dropped the policy of intentionally allowing inflation to run moderately above 2% to compensate for past periods when it was below 2%.  ↳ removed ""shortfalls"" term that focused only on unemployment being too high. {While Powell said they still believe employment can run above estimates without necessarily creating risks to price stability}. (this was kindof a communication fix) ↳ The revised policy framework now more closely aligns with the original 2012 (balanced approach).  **In short: The Fed moved away from 2020 framework back toward 2012 framework and Now is less tolerant of sustained inflation above 2%.** (These changes likely won’t affect near-term policy decisions).  Opinion: <@infinityhedge> ↳ By returning to a focus on price stability and a 2% inflation target, this implies that all concerned should prepare for higher rates for longer despite a rising probability of near-term rate cuts: RSM  *Deutsche, Barclays, BNP, GS, JPM, Nomura expects a Fed Rate Cut in September.   Tldr: Powell was cautiously dovish with hawkish undertone but was essentially neutral And rate decision will depend on the August employment and CPI reports.",18190,False,,True

VIEWS: ↳ Fawad Razaqzada: Market be watching how the market reacts to any mention of inflation being ‘well anchored’ or the labor market ‘cooling more than expected, That sort of language would be music to the ears of dollar bears. On the flip side, a cautious Fed that hints at a ‘wait and see’ approach might stall the rally, at least temporarily.  ↳ Standard chartered: expect 50bps cut, Powell is unlikely to be forthcoming on further easing, dot-plot to suggest an additional 25bps cut this year but just one 25bps cut in 2026.  ↳ BBG: expect 25bps cut.
